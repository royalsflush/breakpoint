This has really been a while... but after 6 months of round-abouting, I have
come back to this skeleton of a blog to get its layout fixed and going. A lot of
changes have happened in the meantime, the biggest of them what I'm fondly
calling "closing boxes". That is: realising the value that you left on the
table. Or, in less corporate-y language, "finishing stuff".

This post closes the first milestone of breakpoint, which is exciting. But it
has taught me something: if you're not going for a particular thing, ask
yourself why. "Round-abouting", the term that I used in the beginning of this
post like it's common colloquial English. What I meant by it is when you dabble
on a bunch of stuff but you never really commit to something. It is normally the
symptom, not the root cause. It can be a symptom of:

* Fear / confidence
* Lack of sufficient skill
* Other (often hidden) priorities

Pay attention to your round-abouting, because it will teach you all these
things. It will teach you were you feel weak, where you can improve, and what's
important to you. For me, the rounda-abouting took the form of two realisations
that I couldn't be more thankful for: wanting to go back into proper software
engineering and "building" stuff. But before that, realising that I wanted to
have a more solid foundation than I had before. So it was exactly the last post
of this blog that made me realise I wanted to focus on learn before I got my
feet proper wet again.

The result? I got accepted into UC Boulder's Master's programme (
https://www.colorado.edu/cs/academics/online-programs/mscs-coursera), and I have
taken about 7 classes to date. I'm having a blast, and it was directly tied to
that one post back in December.

Still, after that long detour, here am I, closing the milestone 0 of this
particular box. I'm unsure when I'll move to milestone 1. I have other boxes
(like the master's) that I believe are more aligned with what I want at this
point in time. I'll keep writing about them here, when I can.
