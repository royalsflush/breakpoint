<h1 id="breakpoint">Breakpoint</h1>

<p>This is a blog, but it’s not a tutorial, it’s not packed with answers, it’s just
a journal-type blog. I want to register my own journey through learning some of 
these technologies. I want someone’s experience when reading the blog to be
following the journey as well.</p>

<h2 id="high-level-concepts">High level concepts</h2>

<p>At its heart, this is a blog. However, as I have described, I want it to read a
lot more like a messy journey of exploration than something that you just 
consult when you’re not sure how to solve that particular LeetCode problem, or
how to model your database for a particular functionality.</p>

<p>I have two concepts that I want to initially focus for Breakpoint:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning DAGs</li>
  <li>Tag forests</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me go over my conceptual idea of each.</p>

<h3 id="learning-dags">Learning DAGs</h3>

<p>This is supposed to be a story. An initial article is going to kick off a
particular theme, and I expect that I’ll be referencing it in other articles
related to the same topic. So naturally, they form a DAG. I would like for
readers be able to see the latest updated DAGs.</p>

<h3 id="tag-forests">Tag forests</h3>

<p>Blogs need to be filtered by tags, but I’m also pretty interested in a couple of
things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Can I plot all the articles in my blog and see how the tags cluster?</li>
  <li>How do the learning DAGs relate to tagging? Is there going to be a lot of 
overlap?</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe this one is just a fancy visualisation of the blog itself…</p>

<p>I still think that the concept of tags is useful and interesting. Perhaps we
want to search for a tag (or an adjacent concept) and get the relevant of each
of the learning DAGs? Okay, so I think now I have a good idea of what I want to
be doing, let me do a brief roadmap</p>

<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<h3 id="milestone-zero-mvp">Milestone zero: MVP</h3>

<ul>
  <li>MVP is just a blog, no fanciness. In particular, I want:
    <ul>
      <li>A Jekyll powered blog that is in this GitHub repo</li>
      <li>It’s published to GitHub pages</li>
      <li>It uses breakpoint.royalsflush.com</li>
      <li>It has a first post detailing the intention of the blog and mulling over
some of what I already mentioned here – I think that, for maximum historic
coolness, I think I want a frozen version of this README. That seems pretty
neat.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="milestone-half-google-analytics">Milestone half: Google analytics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>TL;DR: I want to have analytics for my blog. I don’t think those will amount
to anything exciting, but I still want them.</li>
  <li>Then I want some blog posts. I’m still finishing my minesweeper project, I
think that’s the perfect candidate for my second learning DAG (the first being
breakpoint itself). The reason I’m gonna defer structuring the learning DAG
idea is because I need to understand a bit more about how posts are even going
to be structured, and what makes sense.</li>
  <li>I’ll add manual tags to the blog posts for now</li>
  <li>When I finish minesweeper (see the milestones in
https://github.com/royalsflush/minesweeper), I’ll go over the posts for that,
and any other content I have produced in the meantime and try to distill the
data model for learning DAGs. I’m pretty sure we’re going to have an N:N
relationship for both learning DAGs and tags</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="milestone-one-initial-learning-dags-in-the-home-page">Milestone one: Initial learning DAGs in the home page</h3>

<p>For this milestone, I want to define better:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What are learning DAGs? Sure, they’re graphs, but how do I want the
experience for the reader to be? Should they suggest an order of posts that
goes through a particular project? Perhaps a technology?</li>
  <li>Are those manually curated, or are they auto-generated? I can see that I
might want to make the first learning DAG manually curated. That’s a good fit
for projects, but I think I also want to have an arc for the technologies
(React? Express? Node? Etc etc), and for areas (system design? Frontend?
Languages?). I think it’s an interesting experience, but it’s definitely a
challenge to structure the story.</li>
  <li>How is that going to appear? I think I want a 3D render of the DAG, like a
Metroidvania level. I don’t know, that sounds pretty cool.</li>
  <li>I think when you click on it, you probably want the flattened graph, with
the title of the DAG at the top, then each vertex has a header (the title of
the post itself) and a summary of the article (potentially AI generated? Why
not?)</li>
</ol>

<p>Edit: I think I settled on (1) – I want projects, technologies and topic (which
is a broader categorisation).</p>
